= D4L Maven Repository - Snapshots

Maven repository for latest snapshots of our SDKs.

== Usage

Here you will find our latest snapshots that you could use to test and verify early on.

NOTICE: Dependencies will be updated and cleaned regularly. So don't include them in any production release.

=== Gradle

Please add the following to your root `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`

[source, gradle]
----
// build.gradle.kts
repositories {
    // add
    maven("https://raw.github.com/d4l-data4life/maven-snapshots/main/snapshots")
}
----

== Maintenance

=== Deploy

Is done by our CI SDK bot. No manual deploys allowed.

=== Cleanup

As snapshot dependencies quickly pile up, it is necessary to regularly cleanup old dependencies.

We have a script available that removes old dependencies:

* `./cleanup.main.kts`
* commit changes
